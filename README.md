# ScaleSimV2_DRAMA
In this project I try to use DRAMA with ScaleSim Traces in an automatic way.
I use independently ScaleSim and Drama.
After ScaleSimV2 has generated the traces I use DRAMA to get some DRAM statistics using DRAM traces generated by ScaleSimV2

In this repository I only put channel.py and bridge.py from the DRAMA project, to run the project you need to download ScaleSimV2, add channel.py and bridge.py into the scalesim folder and then run scalesimV2_DRAMA.py script

#Script usage

py Bridge_ScaleSim2_DRAMA topology_path cfg_path result_folder_name

example of use: 

***py Bridge_ScaleSim2_DRAMA C:\Users\[userdirectoryname]\Desktop\Models\deep_voice.csv C:\Users\[userdirectoryname]\Desktop\cfg\SS2_DRAMA\scale_config_64x64_os.cfg result_folder***
